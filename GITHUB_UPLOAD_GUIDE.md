# Uploading Your Project to GitHub

Since we're experiencing some limitations with Git operations in the Replit environment, here's a step-by-step guide to manually upload your project to GitHub:

## Method 1: Download and Upload

1. **Download your project from Replit**:
   - In Replit, click on the three dots (...) in the Files panel
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - This will download a zip file of your entire project

2. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/vibescd/growthpro-marketing
   - Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop the extracted files from the zip, or click to select them
   - Add a commit message like "Initial commit"
   - Click "Commit changes"

## Method 2: GitHub Desktop

1. **Clone the empty repository**:
   - Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you haven't already
   - Clone your empty repository: https://github.com/vibescd/growthpro-marketing

2. **Download and extract your Replit project**:
   - Download your project from Replit as described above
   - Extract the zip file to your local computer

3. **Copy files and push**:
   - Copy all files from your extracted Replit project to the cloned repository folder
   - Open GitHub Desktop, which should detect all the added files
   - Add a commit message like "Initial commit"
   - Click "Commit to main"
   - Click "Push origin"

## Method 3: Command Line (if you have Git installed locally)

1. **Clone the empty repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vibescd/growthpro-marketing.git
   cd growthpro-marketing
   ```

2. **Download and extract your Replit project**:
   - Download your project from Replit as described above
   - Extract the zip file

3. **Copy files, commit, and push**:
   - Copy all files from your extracted Replit project to the cloned repository folder
   - Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Important Files to Include

Make sure your upload includes these key files and directories:
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` - Instructions for using the application
- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Express server
- `shared/` - Shared types and schema definitions
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## Excluding Files

You may want to exclude these files/directories:
- `node_modules/` - NPM packages (these will be reinstalled based on package.json)
- `.git/` - Git metadata directory
- Any environment files with sensitive information

After uploading, your code will be available at: https://github.com/vibescd/growthpro-marketing
